We had a pretty decent end to the week.
We have gone a bit deeper into SQL and Postgres and began to touch on functional programing, which is incredible i might add.
I went to my first Meetup on Thursday at AVVO. It was a good experience. We learned a bit about Redis and i had the opportunity to speak with the recruiter for AVVO. Considering my back ground in the law, i really think AVVO would be a good fit for me somewhere down the line.
On to week 3.
