We have survived to code on.
It has been another long week and its only half way over. It has also been very productive.
We have been learning about SQL and basic database management. It is pretty complex and is in essence learning another language and syntax. It will take awhile to fully figure out but seems rather methodic.
Still trying to get caught up on my portfolio but it will happen.
