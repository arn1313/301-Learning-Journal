Welcome back!
Today was mostly a bit of a refresher of the topics we had covered in the reading.
I am excited about the paired programming aspect of this month and i look forward to learning from my partners and hopefully giving something back also.
I want to find time to practice my JS, so i will hopefully have some time to hit the repl.it exercises today, if not soon.
