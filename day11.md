Huzzah for Mondays.
Worked through the weekend again, so we are firmly at day 18 without taking a day off. Although, i will say i only do some light lifting extra credit and reading on Saturdays.
We had another Sunday meetup yesterday and hacked out some Code Wars and tried to get some progress on my Portfolio but there just seems to be some aspect of it that is just broken.
Today we started working towards a single page model for our sites. Lots of new tags etc to incorporate but i like the direction the page design is going in.
