This week has been very high paced.
We have learned about what seems to be hundreds of Jquery commands, granted we have only touched on a handful of them.
I am really liking how streamlined Jquery makes your code look, replacing lines of code with only a few commands.
I really how much easier it is to render content on to the html versus how laborious it was using vanilla javascript.
I am trying to pace myself so i don't get overwhelmed by all the content, at the same time i don't want to get behind.
I will be working all weekend to make sure i stay on top of it.
