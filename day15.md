Here we go into project week. I am way more excited this time than in 201. I have a great team, not that i did not last time but this one had far fewer "big personalities", so i am stoked.
Cameron had a great project idea using the Cannibis API. We will be creating an app that tracks the logistics of product from growers to the dispensaries. Its a pretty cool idea and one that we could potentially push to a production level someday.
So much to do this weekend. So many tests to take and lots of work to be done but i will be doing it all at home this weekend. Huzzah!
