This has been a long week, i haven't taken a day off since before this all started and i am pretty worn out.
Today we learned how to deploy our pages to Heroku and spent a little more time covering the usage of tokens to access a  database.
The deployment seems rather formulaic but i am sure there will be a few issues along the way. I am a little concerned about the tokens and making sure they are obscured and not made available to our users.
Onward to project week. I am excited and terrified.
