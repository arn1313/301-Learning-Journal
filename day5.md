This has been a really rough week.
Managing the paired programming with the our day being broke into thirds is very difficult.
On friday we learned more about using forms with Jquery and handlebars. It seems like it should be pretty easy to incorporate, once we have some time to get to it.
I am hoping we are given some time to get caught up on our assignments. I think everyone is feeling behind at this point.
